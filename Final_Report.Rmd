# Introduction

We chose to focus on data having to do with heart disease/heart attach indicators to understand which factors impact a person's probability to have a heart attach or summer from strong levels of heart disease. Data was found on Kaggle and was modified from a CDC survey.  See the _Data Dictionary_ section for more details at the end of the document. The dataset contains 252,680 observations. The response variable we have is a binary one telling us if the person being interviewed suffered from a heart attack or not. There are a total of 20 available predictor variables. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Taking a closer look at our predictor variable, we noticed that only 9.4% of participants in the survey had heart disease or a heart attack, 23,893 responded yes versus 229,787 who responded no.  This means that we could just predict a 0 for all observations and we could get an accuracy of over 90%. Since we aren't concerned in this instance with a high accuracy, but actually a decent sensitivity (getting accurate results when someone is at risk of a heart attack or heart disease), we utilized Upsampling in some of our methods to skew the model to predict the results we wanted.  This decreased overall accuracy, but resulted in a much better prediction accuracy of finding those people with heart disease or who had a heart attack.  Even with a loss in accuracy, we felt that this was a wise move as predicting someone who has heart disease is much more important than identifying someone who doesn't have heart disease. See the below bar chart to compare the two catagories visually.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(health, aes(HeartDiseaseorAttack)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 250000), breaks = seq(0, 250000, by = 50000)) +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Count of HeartDiseaseorAttack Observations - Before Upsampling") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA))
```

When it comes to the predictor variables there are 12 binary, 3 numerical, and 5 factor variables. Having fewer numerical variables is less than desireable, especially when it comes to how some of the factor variables are coded/binned.  An example of this terrible survey coding is the __Income__ variable where the CDC survey sets the highest bucket capped at `$`75,000+.  Due to how low that is for the maximum response allowed, a full third of the observations fall into that category.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(health, aes(Income)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100000), breaks = seq(0, 100000, by = 25000)) +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Count of Income Observations") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA))
```

For the three numerical variables, __BMI__, __MentHlth__, and __PhysHlth__, there is a definite skewness that we can see in their distributions.  This is especially true for __PhysHlth__ and __MentHlth__, which are how many times in the last 30 days a survey respondent reported having poor physical or mental health respectively.  A huge percentage of respondents reported zero days, 70% for __MentHlth__ and 63% for __PhysHlth__.  To correct for these skewed variables, we logged __BMI__ to enforce normality constraints.  The For __MentHlth__ and __PhysHlth__ we created binary variables where any value greater than 0 was coded as a 1 and was coded as a 0 otherwise. We originally attempted to log these variables but the skew wasn't reduced very much and we ended up finding that the binary variables worked out much better. These transformations were valuable in the various classification methods that we tried, even though they did reduce our numerical variables to really just the __ln.BMI__ variable.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
grid.arrange(
ggplot(health, aes(BMI)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 75000), breaks = seq(0, 75000, by = 25000)) +
  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of BMI") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA))
,
ggplot(health, aes(ln.BMI)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30) +

  ylab("Count") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Logged BMI") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA))

nrow = 1)
grid.arrange(
ggplot(health, aes(MentHlth)) +

  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA))
,
ggplot(health, aes(PhysHlth)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30) +
